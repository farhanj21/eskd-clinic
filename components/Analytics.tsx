/**
 * The Google Tag Manager container, and the only script that loads it.
 *
 * GTM is the single tag on the site. GA4, Google Ads conversions and anything
 * added later all live inside the container, so a new destination never needs a
 * deploy — which is exactly why the GA4 measurement ID appears nowhere in this
 * repo, and should not be added here.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 *   next/script with strategy="afterInteractive" rather than the raw <script>
 *     this replaced. Next then loads GTM after hydration instead of racing the
 *     page's own JavaScript, and — importantly — reinjects it correctly, where
 *     a hand-written tag in <head> could be dropped on a client-side
 *     navigation.
 *
 *   site_env is pushed before the container loads, so every hit GTM sees is
 *     labelled with the deployment it came from. GTM loads on preview
 *     deployments on purpose, so tags can be tested in Preview mode against a
 *     real staging URL; the container is where staging traffic gets excluded
 *     from GA4 (add "site_env equals production" as a trigger exception), not
 *     here. Nothing on a preview is indexed, so this costs nothing in search.
