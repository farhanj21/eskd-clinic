/**
 * Sticky "Call now" bar, fixed to the bottom of the screen on mobile.
 *
 * Emergency traffic is overwhelmingly mobile and urgent, and the number in the
 * hero disappears the moment someone scrolls. This keeps the one action that
 * matters a single tap away at every point on the page.
 *
 * Hidden on desktop, where the header already carries the number. Call-only by
 * design: adding a second button splits the decision at exactly the moment the
 * visitor is least able to make one.
 *
 * The site-wide listener in components/AnalyticsEvents.tsx already counts this
 * tap as a call_click. The extra emergency_call_click below is kept because a
 * GTM trigger was built on it before that listener existed, and because an
 * emergency call is worth its own conversion regardless.
