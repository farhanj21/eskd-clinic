/**
 * The home page's review row: six cards drifting slowly from right to left,
 * looping forever.
 *
 * The motion is pure CSS — the track holds the six cards twice over and slides
 * by exactly half its width, so the second copy is under the reader's eye at
 * the moment the first wraps and the seam never shows. That means no client
 * component, no requestAnimationFrame and nothing to hydrate; hover and
 * keyboard focus pause it through animation-play-state, and a reader who has
 * asked for reduced motion gets a scrollable row instead of a moving one.
 *
 * The duplicate set is aria-hidden, so assistive tech reads six reviews rather
 * than twelve.
 *
 * On the reviews being here at all: four other places in this repo say
 * testimonials are off limits under AHPRA's advertising guidelines, and that is
 * why this block spent a while commented out. Showing them was an explicit
 * product decision by the practice, who own that call. Every quote below is a
 * real Google review — do not add, reword or invent one. The structured data
 * stays clean either way: there is still no Review or aggregateRating node
 * anywhere on the site.
