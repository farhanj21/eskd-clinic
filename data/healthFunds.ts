/**
 * The health funds shown in the "all major health funds" logo rows, on the
 * home page and on /fees.
 *
 * Single source of truth so the two rows can never drift apart. A fund with a
 * `logo` renders as an image; one without falls back to its name as text, so a
 * new fund can be listed the moment we claim through it and given artwork later.
 *
 * `width` and `height` are the file's INTRINSIC pixel size, not the rendered
 * size. They only exist so the browser can reserve the right box and avoid
 * layout shift — the row sizes every logo by height in CSS (.ins-logos .lg img).
 * If you replace a file, update these numbers to match it.
 *
 * These are third-party registered trademarks. Use the artwork exactly as each
 * fund supplies it: don't recolour, stretch, or add effects.
