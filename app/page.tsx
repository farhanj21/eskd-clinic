//
// `short` takes over below 600px, where the three cells sit side by side and
// each is only about 100px wide. Every full label wraps to two or three lines
// at that width, and the longest of them sets the height of the panel — so the
// phone gets one-word labels instead. Same technique as the
// .story-copy-full / .story-copy-short pair further down this page.
//
// `count`, `decimals` and `suffix` drive the count-up: the figure sits in its
// own <span data-count>, which the observer in components/ScrollEffects.tsx
// animates from zero the first time the panel comes into view. Anything that
// must not be counted — the word "years", the stars — goes in `after`, outside
// that span. The server renders the finished figure, so with JS off (or
// reduced motion on) the panel reads exactly as it always has.
