/**
 * Every indexable route, as an absolute production URL.
 *
 * URLs are always built from SITE_URL, so a preview deployment still lists the
 * production host rather than advertising itself.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded, and why each one stays out:
 *   /home                  — redirects permanently to /, so it is not a page
 *   /book                  — redirects to /online-booking
 *   /comprehensive-care-visit — redirects to /new-patient-comprehensive-care-visit
 *   /services/check-up-clean  — redirects to /services/check-ups
 *   /areas/<slug>          — redirect to /dentist-<slug>
 *   /api/*                 — the contact endpoint, not content
 *   /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml — not content
 *
 * The rule behind that list: a redirect source never belongs in a sitemap.
 * Listing one asks Google to crawl a URL we have already told it has moved,
 * which wastes crawl budget and muddies the canonical signal. Every source in
 * next.config.ts's redirects() must therefore stay out of STATIC_PATHS.
