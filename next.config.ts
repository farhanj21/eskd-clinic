/**
 * Every URL this site has served that no longer exists, and where it goes now.
 *
 * Each one is a route that was live in the repository under an older name and
 * was renamed or removed without a redirect, so any inbound link or indexed
 * result still pointing at it landed on the 404 page — losing both the visitor
 * and whatever ranking the old URL had earned.
 *
 * Two rules held throughout:
 *
 *   Every destination is a final URL, never another redirect. /offer's page was
 *     renamed twice (→ /comprehensive-care-visit → /new-patient-comprehensive-
 *     care-visit) and /booking's twice (→ /book → /online-booking); each is
 *     sent straight to where the content actually lives, so nobody pays for two
 *     round trips and no signal is diluted through a chain.
 *
 *   The destination is the page that replaced the old one, not the home page.
 *     A redirect to "/" reads to Google as a soft 404 and drops the ranking
 *     entirely — /take-care-of-you was the new-patient offer campaign, so it
 *     goes to the page carrying that offer today.
 *
 * A redirect costs nothing until someone requests the URL, so a path that
 * turns out never to have been indexed is simply never asked for. The reverse
 * mistake — a missing redirect — is only discovered from the 404 report weeks
 * later. Anything renamed from here on belongs in this list on the same commit.
